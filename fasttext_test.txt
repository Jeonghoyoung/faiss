The present invention relates to a power generating apparatus which is capable of generating electric power using the torque of a power device, hydraulic power, or wind power. Specifically, magnetic bodies are radially separated and arranged on stationary nonmagnetic plates which are installed vertically distanced from each other, and a rotary disc is formed between the stationary plates wherein horizontally winding coil members are arranged radially, so electric power is generated by inducing an electric charge to the rotational coil members separated from the magnetic bodies which are themselves independently arranged. Thus, the power generation productivity is excellent and highly efficient power generation is enabled even at a low speed because the load caused by the magnetism between magnetic bodies is eliminated. The motive power of the rotary disc and continuous torque are increased as a result of the centrifugal force of the rotary disc and alternative operation between magnetism and repulsion of the added magnetic bodies, so high electric power can be generated by even weak wind power, wave power, steam, or hydraulic power through minimization of power loss.
